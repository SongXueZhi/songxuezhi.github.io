 - ðŸ”­  I am a PhD student in [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yijian Wu](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81310483038/publications?Role=author) and [Prof. Bihuan Chen](https://chenbihuan.github.io/), mentored by [Prof. Peng Xin](https://cspengxin.github.io/). I received a research intern invitation from National University of Singapore("NUS") in 2019, supervised by Prof. [Yun Lin](http://linyun.info/). I received my master degree in computer technology from [Donghua University](https://english.dhu.edu.cn/) in 2021.
 - ðŸŒ±  My research focuses on software quality assurance, particularly automated testing and defect analysis through static/dynamic program analysis and AI-driven approaches like large language models (LLMs).
